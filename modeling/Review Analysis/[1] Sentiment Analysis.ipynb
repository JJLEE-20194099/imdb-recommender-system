about itprobably mainly forbidden planet recall do not actually like upon see same most anime at time because simply be not really my thing at time back then my young self be all about arnie jcvd so do not really fit into my see be on little anime binge right now it time revisit supernatural samurai epic firstly what all about well like other anime film plot actually quite simplistic take place feudal japan jubei ronin sort wander masterless samurai look work upon rescue female ninja kagero jubei find himself catch up battle against eight devil kimon who be team supernatural ninja hire by clan protect their secret gold mining operation gold be payment shogun dark protection turn shogun dark want use gold buy spanish weaponry overthrow current japanese government bottom line jubei kagero must defeat all bad guy protect animation so let just get down nittygritty look amazing stun sumptuous director once again yoshiaki kawajiri wicked city vampire hunter d bloodlust fame obvious style animation silky smooth throughout tonne tiny detail example there be many simple shot nature such firefly ripple water tree bird be there merely add atmosphere moment but at same time be beautifully draw animate there absolutely no slack on any frame animation assure you every frame look like an exquisite watercolour painting from bamboo forest mystical woodland shimmer body water add various striking sequence utilise only one or two colour such red black or shade blue which look very dynamic nonconsensual sex you might expect sword base anime feature there indeed lot violenceand amaze ninja base action nothing short breathtaking character whizz around screen slice dice supersmooth animation think first fight we see set out stall group ninja massacre whilst investigate an attack on local village by one eight demon kimon they be brutally cut piece by his fly blade which then culminate their leader have his arm rip off out their socket shower claret say demon do actually eventually get his own blade firmly implant centre his skull there be some amazing katana fight between jubei various villain which be heighten by sound effect which really add some weight proceeding course you have obligatory supernatural element gore trickery be staple diet these staple kawajiri anime seem be nudity rape gulp yes once again lead female character kagero seem be more sexual toy certain fantasy rather than strong female character although she still now whilst wicked city be more bizarre it body horror element feel bit more realistic almost sure character do rape be supernatural demon but they still have human form be generally dress historic attire so yeah there be nipple suck finger rope bondage whilst be unconscious fact kagero body cover poisonous toxic cannot be cure make porn aspect seem more dangerously kinky vindicate if at all possible or just methe other rather hilarious uncomfortable plot point fact dakuan informs jubei only way rid himself poison he give him dakuan deliberately inject poison into jubei via ninja star blackmail him into do his bidding have sex kagero apparently toxins across kagero body will combat reverse poison jubei body so little pressure there then unfortunately kagero jubei decline she fancy him but later on he kiss her cure himself way so why do not dakuan just say yes there lgbtq representation old anime seem time go by people have be happy showcase gay character despite what try force down our throat gemma righthand man yurimaru his male lover he even push back on fellow female villain advance how about then we do not see any man love surprising when you think about but representation lover angst definitely wise men another aspect these anime seem keep pop up wise old man character something have point out previous review yep story jubei kagero be aid by short trolllike character dakuan dakuan government spy charge help jubei kill demon already state he do so by poison jubei promise him cure after he complete mission you might expect dakuan one these character hide much his skill only show odd glimmer what he can do we know he have some kind special power we know he can move quickly despite his appearance an expert stealth again like other similar character dakuan also comedic relief filmas other character it usual anime cliche truth be tell main protagonist jubei your standard good look westernesque anime hero slim wiry physique lightning katana skill long flow dark hair his female partner again your standard attractive westernesque look heroine slim physique slightly tomboyish hairstyle also lightning fast weapon skillsmost main bad guy also have very cliched look about them which we have see many time now thank film like himuro gemma large hulk handsome westernesque look villain lantern jaw almost invincible fight skill but he demon whereas yurimaru typical calm but deadly handsome skinny villain who dress all white have even longer flow hair look almost religious he able generate electricity through his body conduct down steel wire he strangle people other demon literally come across like capcom fight roster there ninja bloke who can utilise shadow sexy chick live snake tattoo massive bloke who can turn his skin stone another sexy chick who can manipulate gunpowder all manner weird way hunchback live hornet nest his backin short almost everyone very good look lovely straight flow hair great muscle structure either just right hulking or monstrous at same time there also typical exaggerate facial anime style where character have extremely strong jaw chisel cheekbone long chin their feature be basically very perfect hair oh everyone really fit even people do back can make you bit have hint at here there nowadays will come across rather unoriginal but only because many property have more than likely be highly influence by other property be originally influence by anime you can spot so many idea will have pop up so many flick over year not mention videogames hell anime almost like samurai not bad thing love overall sizzle action sequence hyper turbo character absolutely gorgeous artwork animation be just so good

throughout  interestingly videogame adaptation be make two year before dumpster fire be street fighter but both movie be release late  double dragon come first november be guess studio know they have piece crap on their hand possibly think release during height beat em up craze street fighter so what do we have here well it pretty much standard  fantasy plot mixed lot hokey oriental mysticism thousand year ago ancient china an army shadow warrior lay siege city order save his people king sacrifice himself create powerful medallion say medallion give it owner immeasurable power over body soul power be so strong king presumably before he die split medallion two one half give power over soul other body naturally both half have since be apart hide from each other no clue who shadow warrior be or be no clue why they be attack chinese city no idea how king make medallion by sacrifice himself why would medallion be so powerful be king wizard or something do medallion save his city people why be ask these question well guess because all seem kinda important plot it huge chunk expositionin present then futuristic day  nasty villain call victor inexplicably change his name koga shuko later on after medallion so he can rule new angeles los angeles he find one half on bad set make look like chinese village but course other half own by lee brother lee brother be course base on two main character you can play videogame billy jimmy unfortunately they could not even get right they cast scott wolf mark dacascos now whilst agree wolf have boyish look dacascos have martial art skill they most definitely cannot pas brother put all thing aside you have remember terrible only reasonable excuse but they do get their individual red blue outfit right so there thati jimmy also have guardian adopt mother just happen be an asian lady martial art skill lucky innit image how crap thing would have turn out if their adopt mother be bore white woman who work bank clerk satori imada julia nickson essentially stereotypically wise mystical asian character thing she not particularly mystical villain we have glorious robert patrick ham character victor shuko be create but add into  neo geo videogame some reason character have hair like vanilla ice an obviously dyed goatee eyeliner dress like an evil oriental sorcerer some kind usual obligatory dress code his sidekick be linda lash kristina wagner who base off whip wield female fighter videogame finally huey jeff imada lewis al leong who be your bog standard asian martial art henchman but not base on any game character believe duo name be nod actual huey lewis some reason at one point shuko ask huey lewis any news reference huey lewis not forget bo abobo nil allen stewart who also another videogame character villain game be huge roided up obviously be prethe rock there be not many guy big back then but stewart initially good similarity ala they fudge character right up by mutate him into some ginormous hemorrhoid he then proceed do literally nothing rest so be set future make  there only one direction could possibly go yes right it dystopian post apocalyptic flood hellhole overrun various punk gang skateboard vigilante group massive earthquake destroy half california yadda yadda yadda it remarkable how city seem crumble into wasteland fill gang when natural disaster happen why do half

gang fact some them dress postal uniform mime makeup clown outfit posh grammar you have power corp vigilante gang thatwell be not sure what they actually do but they be all kid do they fight back against baddie street gang do they fight back against police their curfew not really sure but what do know their attire totally tubular seriously gang most  thing about entire it unbelievably cringeworthy large gang kid various age large secret base fill arcade skateboard ramp electronic equipment some weird green it just an adventure playground cover graffiti their leader marian alyssa

whilst she on all four crawl into you might expect there be tonne mean tonne fast not so witty quip mug into camera by virtually all involve all action centre around vapid childish martial art sequence just look bad even back  you can see no contact be make sound effect be way too much everybody over act when get strike etcits legitimately embarrass watch at time other action sequence focus on vehicle which be just bad because it all very slow basic make no sense why vehicle be way they be seemingly no petrol but run on anything you can stick into tank how would common street gang get hold massive x oh they stick metal teeth on front grill because hella intimidate speed boat chase sequence epitome how naff really billy jimmy find speed boat escape on river bad guy just happen be all suit up all black wetsuits couple jetskis ready wait take pursuit think only positive thing can say about sequence be nice look matte painting dot throughout these image ruin la alongside live action shot do genuinely look quite good quite liked idea these large metal strut hold building place because aftershock special effect on shuko his shadow form when activate his half medallion be

fighting business etcits essentially massive fanboy wet dream project like saya steampunk batman or batman set space or future or batman set age pirate or ancient rome etcthe plot seem be oneoff affair not link any previous work or anything come up it literally appear be case batman japan sound cool let see how turn out plot insanely off wall bizarre crazy barely coherent say least yes it set feudal japan but most part could simply be anywhere do not matter long run only costumes remind you it yeah gorilla grodd tire all other good gotham villain hog batman all time their plot get his way so he decide get rid them all so he build some machine send them all back feudal you do naturally batman get catch up too somehow entire batman family hero oh some his tech so now old bruce stick feudal japan without cover urban gotham only few his gadget he find himself up against grodd joker penguin poison ivy twoface harley quinn bane deathstroke no riddler luckily he do have robin nightwing red hood alfred catwoman entire batman ninja clan on his side so it not one way streetthe start off suitably dark stormy gotham but soon zap back through time feudal japan it at point where still relatively grounded well ground one can be travel back through time batman out his element he vulnerable without his gadget his urban jungle anything could happen hold grounded approach batman struggle cope his ancient surroundings like be unable escape grapple up tall building but slowly scene by scene thing start become more ridiculous plot unfolds when say ridiculous mean giant transform fortress fight against giant samurai shape entity make up monkey then giant batman make up bat plus there whole ninja bat clan thing fact joker have machine gun alfred hide batmobile local hut underground light penguin have his penguin just all tech on show etcnevertheless it when batman appear japan you really notice how beautiful anime here japan render cgi alas no hand draw art but oh boy exquisite clearly woodblock artwork hokusai great wave similar work have influence overall design here sky roll countryside have intricate pattern weave into them there be also numerous sequence mainly one both harley joker which appear have be animate watercolours or cgi equivalent really diversify set artwork okazaki man behind afro samurai be character designer here obvious if you know say anime franchise think all character look great be easily recognisable from their comic origin but still cannot help but think hand drawn animation would have look well however do really like how takashi incorporated genuine traditional ancient japanese attire both formal battle wear into character appearance by mean be indeed cool see batman his own batman style samurai battle armour which be sure many have see fanart before twas also neat see joker period clothe make him look more like jester harlequin or nobleman at time not all character look cool but basically villain be samurai style armour where hero be more styled battle attire but everything have relevance so yes overall all look very slick very sharp very colourful extremely well animatedso whilst be kinda expect something along line seven samurai or yojimbo batman roam ancient japan like ronin handicap without his technology have take down each villain one stage at time an old fashion yet admittedly manner what we actually get zany batman adventure jam almost every anime into story result very japanese feature which may or may not land folk west do land me well all honesty not really love entire concept love artwork appreciate all hard work involve but ala totally tune out from halfway point when thing just go bonkers just want something more grounded anime giant fight robotsthe finale be simply most surreal tomfoolery have see some time do not watch lot anime true anime fan may be normal they may enjoy but be not me just think transformer voltron gundam some steampunk an army monkey bat ninjas then throw batman universe into mix voila total insanity lot double cross boot question how character even manage build these giant robot ancient japan do not even come into there no point question would have like see more other villain too story do tend focus more on joker do not wanna say style over substance because would differ totally correct kinda mean but there definitely an element at play here there substance there tonne style but admittedly it all spread over wafer thin plot at end day you cannot really get around fact be probably only do because simply look sounded cool batman

creator hideyuki kikuchi book seriesso what happen time well nothing much have change actually year  ad vampire still rule earth their technology supernatural power nonetheless our goodlooking fearless vampire hunter d still at still track down kill undead but would you adam eve another silly girl have get herself kidnap by one these pesky bloodsucker vampire nobleman name meier link have supposedly run off charlotte her father elbourne hire d find her bring her home or if she her so another stereotypical plotline again only time d have competition from team vampire hunter call marcus brother whilst link hire team mutant call big change here when you see anime obviously visuals not there anything wrong original  look personally prefer but  by far more spectacular offering animation be helm by japanese animation studio madhouse inc boy do they nail now be no anime expert fact know nothing have only see around five anime movie but me be bestlooking anime have ninja scroll virtually common knowledge anime look move beautifully if you ever wanna prove someone then show them moviethe animation incredible every shot every frame every sequence like work art load detail but apart from main character it really everything else stand out from major minor example animation on d horse gallop look completely accurate real horse way d cape flap wind perfect detail on small simple bit scenery like play card mechanic interior exterior decoration garment weapon sharp composition every shot aweinspiring all look so good so epic course be far more lavish than before dark gloomy village at start sumptuously gothic look castle at end be prime example amount detail design go into my simple word do no justice truth be tell but believe when say there not single part do back eyepoppingly goodas already state another change time inclusion few more character mainly marcus brother now these vampire hunter felt bit cliched me your typical look character really on other hand they also give me strong blade ii vibe although come out before blade ii but yeah you have huge hulk male nolt huge hulking axe weapon feisty female leila skinny guy kyle who good at throw blade malnourish look disabled psychic call grove their leader borgoff who look like typical samurai type bloke chompin on cigar they also drive around armoured tank thing look like be borrow from mad max marcus brother be solid bunch character offer more than main antagonist or his wannabe bride ala meier link do not really give u much merely come across like horny emo teen try have his way young girl do not really like his design either what hair bead he want her but do not want drag her into his undead world kinda cliche if you want girl just bite her be do link obsession charlotte elbourne she do nothing entire virtually lifeless she merely walk plot device link d brother not really surprising d leila get best plot narrative when discuss their life one recuperation scenedespite how good feature look some brilliant action scene first graveyard battle there be still me negative point be either unexplained or just plain odd example an early desert set scene d come across these gigantic creature seemingly live under desert dune but can also fly they do unmake anything they just emerge from dune fly whilst d use them like step stone across desert what be about then on marcus brother team grove disabled psychic but what his power exactly he can create ghostly entity laser beam there also still weird issue technology franchise people use horse carriage even when vehicle be clearly available there be also various type gun around yet main character use old fashioned weapon like sword course there whole storyline vampire use spaceship spaceship get city night which just felt bit naff frankly city on another planet real or metaphor death must also mention add plot twist involve longdead vampire ghost carmilla who roam castle chaythe where link try get where spaceship felt she be not really need her role plot twist just seem be twist sake twist felt like be time could have be use d battle lead me mutant barbarois link hire barbarois protect him he pay them hundred million dollar so dollar be still thing then but have me think what would mutants live some underground temple thing want money they do disappear use any technology but surely they would obviate their mutant skill once again first question how life on earth get point mutant such wide variety power take caroline example female who can change into tree vine etcbasically she like an xmen character also find barbarois leader look just like more evil version dungeon master from dungeon dragonsthe few negative aside gothic western fantasy still one best anime have come across quality visuals second none despite fact actually do kinda prefer more simplistic look first but slick visuals animation really boost action sequence time see mutant backflip away from view string silver arrow strike ground highly detailed horsedrawn carriage link cross massive elaborate arch bridge lead even more intricately detailed castle chaythe or staggeringly atmospheric excellent graveyard battle add genuine orchestral score set mood obligatory graphic violence some nudity which suit franchise so me crazy but actually prefer original anime over why dunno really guess original just have simplistic charm which warm my cockle like compare slick modernday videogame graphic retro pixel graphic me retro pixel graphic win every time even though do admire enjoy slick modernday graphic you do obviate have see original enjoy but recommend',\n",
